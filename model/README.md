# Sei model files

Please download the trained model and other data `.npy` files required to run variant effect prediction from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4906996) into this directory before running the Sei framework.

We provide a subset of the files contained in the Zenodo record here (e.g. `sei.py`) so that those interested in reviewing the Sei model architecture can view it without having to download the full trained model `sei.pth` file.
